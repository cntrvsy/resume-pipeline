# resume-pipeline

This is a Terminal Application that generates a different resumes based on input from a YAML file.

##why?
- A General Resume doesnt cut it anymore. As someone who has studied Applied Computing Technology with a focus on Software Development, most hiring managers expect a more tailored and personalized resume to the specific personalized. its no longer just "front-end engineer" or "back-end engineer" but a "product implementation engineer"( yes this was an actual job title and role involved basically creating UIs in Svelte, yeah...).
- The job market is competitive, AI is great but that means its harder to stand out, and having a personally crafted resume for each job you apply for can make a significant difference in getting noticed by potential employers as most recruiters apperently dont spend more than 20 seconds scanning through your resume. This application allows users to create custom resumes by providing input in a YAML file, which can then be formatted and styled depending on the typst template provided. make it easier to just pick what is relevant, create a resume from that data and apply it to the job description.

##Why not use word or google docs?

Its time consuming and depressing to spend 2 hours on a resume to not even get a rejection email. plus depending on the Recruiter "influencer" you follow, some styles are just difficult to make work and fit your content requiring you to spend even more time on what ever [method](https://www.evidenced.app/blog/8-alternatives-to-star-method) they swear by. This application's goal is to allow users to create custom resumes quickly and easily by just selecting which points are relevant to said job title, Data is Stored in a YAML file, and the final PDF is generated using Typst.
